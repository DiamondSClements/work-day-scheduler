# Work-day-scheduler

## Description
Calendar application used to save events utilizing HTML, CSS, and jQuery.

## Installation
* This assignement implemented starter code provided by the class repo. The starter coded used the Days.js library.
* Since I never used the Days.js library, I researched the website https://day.js.org/ to figure out how to apply the elements to my functions. I also used https://api.jquery.com/ to help build my functions.

## Usage
The purpose of this assignment was to build a daily planner so the user could store important events. 
The time blocks for the planner are color coded based on the user's events; gray for past events, red for events currently taking place, and green for future events.
The planner automatically updates the date.
